In order to write modules in Python (2.7)
What you need is below, if you speak Unix.

Example:

user@host ~/irc-client/modules
$ cat mod_mycommand.py
def mod_mycommand(_from, _line):
  # do something with the parameters 
  # from and line.
  return "Hello from python to " + _from + " for saying " + _line"


00:12 <n00b> .mycommand
00:12 <\0x00> Hello from python to noob for saying .mycommand

Just note that the module file and method name should be the same,
taking two parameters as string, `from' and `line' respectively,
and returning a string as the reply message.

`from' is the channel (or private message) from which the message was sent.
`line' is the whole line the user has sent -- including the bot command,
so it's up to you to parse it the way you want.

For writing new bot commands in C, see ~/irc-client/modules/mod_example.h
